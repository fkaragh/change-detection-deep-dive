# ChangeDetectionDeepDive

This project is an Angular application designed to explore and demonstrate the concepts of change detection in Angular.  

It includes various components such as [`CounterComponent`](../../../../../../c:/Users/fkara/Documents/GitHub/change-detection-deep-dive/src/app/counter/counter.component.ts ), [`MessagesComponent`](../../../../../../c:/Users/fkara/Documents/GitHub/change-detection-deep-dive/src/app/messages/messages.component.ts ), [`InfoMessageComponent`](../../../../../../c:/Users/fkara/Documents/GitHub/change-detection-deep-dive/src/app/info-message/info-message.component.ts ), and services like [`MessagesService`](../../../../../../c:/Users/fkara/Documents/GitHub/change-detection-deep-dive/src/app/messages/messages.service.ts ) to illustrate how change detection works in Angular applications.  

The project uses Angular's experimental zoneless change detection and signals to manage state and reactivity.  
The application is set up with standard Angular configurations for building, serving, and testing the project.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
